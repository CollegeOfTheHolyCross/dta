        <h2>What is this?</h2>

        <p>The purpose of the Digital Transgender Archive (DTA) is to increase the accessibility of

        transgender history by providing an online hub for digitized historical materials, born­digital

        materials, and information on archival holdings throughout the world. </p>

        <p> The DTA uses the term transgender to refer to a broad and inclusive range of non­normative

        gender practices. We treat transgender as a practice rather than an identity category in order

        to bring together a trans­historical and trans­cultural collection of materials related to trans­ing

        gender. We collect materials from anywhere in the world with a focus on materials created

        before the year 2000.</p>
